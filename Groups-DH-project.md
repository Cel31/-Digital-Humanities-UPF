With renowned works and authors associated with Barcelona, such as Carlos Ruiz Zafon, Merce Rodoreda, Carmen Laforet and Maria Aurelia Capmany, our initiative aims to provide a cultural and educational experience, tracing the literary footsteps and landscapes these authors portray in some of their work.

- __Topic__ - We had thought about doing the project about art and AI. The idea is to select some famous artists (with the characteristics that define them) and, by using AI, generate another piece of art following thr patterns of that artist. The goal would investigate how AI works, how we have to talk with it, and if AI can be passed off as those artists. Apart from that part of "investigation", we thought about generate/create a website for the project, maybe for education or to let know to people how efficient IA can be.
